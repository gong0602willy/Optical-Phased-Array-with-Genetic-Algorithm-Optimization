# Optical-Phased-Array-with-Genetic-Algorithm-Optimization
->This project targets simulation and optimization of silicon photonics optical phased array (OPA). 
->The first part is the construction of simulation environment using array factor (AF). 
->The second part includes the evolution process of genetic algorithm, which can also apply on 
  experimental automation in order to find optimized parameters efficiently.
->The third part is some functions used to plot various radiation pattern.

Platform: Python 3

The test radiation patterns are exported from ANSYS HFSS as csv. file, includes list of gain 
over sperical angle theta/phi = 0,2,4...360. You can try the code with the radiation pattern 
attached "Gain-Plot-3.csv"
